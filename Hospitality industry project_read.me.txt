Project: Business & Data Intelligence Dashboard for AtliQ Grands
Overview
AtliQ Grands, a renowned luxury hotel chain with multiple five-star properties across India, has been a prominent player in the hospitality industry for over 20 years. However, in recent times, the company has been experiencing a decline in market share and revenue, primarily due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective decision-making at the management level.

To regain its competitive edge, AtliQ Grands decided to incorporate Business and Data Intelligence to make data-driven decisions and optimize revenue management. As they lacked an in-house data analytics team, the company hired an external service provider to develop a Power BI dashboard using their historical data.

Objective
The objective of this project was to develop a Power BI Dashboard that would provide AtliQ Grands with deep insights into their historical data, enabling them to make more informed decisions in areas such as:

Revenue Management
Market Share Analysis
Customer Segmentation
Booking Trends and Seasonal Analysis
Performance by Hotel Property
Key Features
Historical Data Analysis: Leveraging past performance data to identify trends, seasonal fluctuations, and booking patterns across multiple properties.
Revenue Insights: Visualizing revenue data to monitor performance, optimize pricing strategies, and identify revenue gaps.
Competitive Benchmarking: Providing insights into competitor performance to help AtliQ Grands develop strategies to recapture market share.
Interactive Reporting: Creating interactive and dynamic reports for various departments, from management to operations, to enable data-driven decision-making.
Customer Segmentation: Analyzing customer behavior and segmenting them for targeted marketing and personalized offerings.
Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI: For creating dynamic, interactive dashboards and reports.
SQL: For data extraction and transformation.
Excel: For preliminary data cleaning and analysis.
Historical Hotel Data: Data from AtliQ Grands' past booking and financial records.
Outcome
The developed dashboard empowers AtliQ Grandsâ€™ management team to track key performance indicators (KPIs), optimize revenue strategies, and stay ahead of competitors by leveraging data-driven insights. This project helped AtliQ Grands move towards more effective decision-making and regain its foothold in the luxury/business hotel category.
